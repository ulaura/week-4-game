Variables for program
---------------------
var crystal-1 = random number generated for first crystal.
var crystal-2 = random number generated for second crystal.
var crystal-3 = random number generated for third crystal.
var crystal-4 = random number generated for fourth crystal.

var computerChoice = random number generated and visible to user. 
var userCounter = the number the user adds to by clicking each crystal.

var wins = The number of times the user has won the game.
var losses = The number of times the user has lost the game. 

The value for each crystal is generated and then hidden from the user!
Each crystal randomizes from 1 to 12.

computerChoice random number range is 18 to 120. 
This is always visible to the user. 

userCounter is always visible to the user. 



On click events for each crystal
--------------------------------
Each click adds the crystal's random number to userCounter.


If/Else If/Else statements to check userCounter against computerChoice.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
If userCounter === computerChoice:
	User wins.
	wins++
	resetGame()**

Else If userCounter >= computerChoice: (User's number exceeds the computer number)
	User loses.
	losses++
	resetGame()**



**function resetGame():
	Make the computer generate a new random number.
	Make all four crystals generate a new random number.
	Set userCounter back to zero. 
	(But leave the wins and losses counters alone)
